                    <p><img src="IMAGES/about us p4.jpg" height="110px" width="110px">Participation of the Community and Project Assistance:
                   The group gives communities the tools they need to carry out neighbourhood environmental projects
                   that deal with their particular problems. It assists communities in planning and carrying out
                    projects including waste reduction programs, clean energy installations, and reforestation by
                   offering funds, technical support, and project management assistance. Through its online
                   community, where users may interact, exchange ideas, and work together on projects,
                   the organisation also promotes a feeling of community</p>

                   that guide its projects and activities. Reports, papers, and presentations containing
                   research findings are disseminated to the public in an effort to promote informed

        <p>Program for Green Experiential Leadership (GELP)
            The goal of the Green Experiential Leadership Program (GELP), a proprietary leadership development program,
             is to identify people with leadership potential in the environmental and conservation sectors and provide them
             with the tools to assume leadership roles. Participants will apply their leadership abilities in both virtual and 
             real-world tasks </p>

        <p>Green Network (GN) Promotes succession planning, mentoring, ongoing education, and knowledge exchange while working to establish
            an active network of environmentalists and conservationists (public organizations, corporate owners and/or senior managers,
             green crews from all levels, academia, etc.). Using the network, GFF will also assemble supporters of the vision, who will assist
              in defining the requirements of the sector, offering input on how well GFF is doing its work, and assisting in identifying
               potential leaders for GFF's leadership programs</p>

        <p>Green Care (GC) advocates for the needs of those working in the environmental and conservation sectors who have difficulties 
            in their daily lives as a result of their jobs' demands. In addition to requesting and managing the assistance received,
             GFF will increase public awareness of the circumstances and hardships they endure. This will, in GFF's opinion, 
             help retain more talent in the industry, some of which may advance into important leadership roles and have a bigger future
              influence.</p>
